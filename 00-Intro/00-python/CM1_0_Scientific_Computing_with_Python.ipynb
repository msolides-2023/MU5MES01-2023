    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. \n",
    "\n",

    "* ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    " * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
    " * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",

    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
